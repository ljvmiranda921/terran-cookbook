## FAQ

- **I don't want to compile your source files, I just want the cookbook** Understood. As we speak, we are setting up a continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) workflow that uploads the cookbooks in `master` in Dropbox.
- **Why are you using LaTeX?** Who could say no to algorithmic kerning, fancy typesetting, and programmer-friendly workflows?  We like using LaTeX because it jives nicely with the Github developer workflow (posting Issues, writing Pull Requests, and etc.).
- **I want to contribute but I don't know how to use LaTeX** No worries! Post an issue with (1) the particular recipe and the (2) cookbook it belongs to. Then, we can add it ourselves! Better yet, we can also guide you in creating your own Pull Request!
- **Do you have an Overleaf document for this?** There's none as of this moment. We're setting up something soon, so stay tuned!
